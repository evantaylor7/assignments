        We are a non-profit organization with the goal of preserving and aiding turtle populations around the globe. With each purchase a customer makes, we fund rehabilitation centers for endangered species. We continually conduct research on newly endangered as well as thriving species to gain tools to aid brother turtle in the fight for existence on the rapidly changing planet. As the oceans continue to become more toxic, coral reefs will continue to disappear. This issue hurts turtles in many ways, and it is our job to act!
